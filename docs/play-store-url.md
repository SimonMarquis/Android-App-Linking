    https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/linking-to-google-play.html#UriSummary

[`https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.smarquis.applinks&url=link%3A%2F%2Fsmarquis.fr%2Faction%3Fkey%3Dvalue%23data&referrer=my%20referrer%20data`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.smarquis.applinks&url=link%3A%2F%2Fsmarquis.fr%2Faction%3Fkey%3Dvalue%23data&referrer=my%20referrer%20data){ .md-button }

Very similar to the [Market scheme](market-scheme.md).

## Web

This url contains additional query parameters that will be handled by the Play Store app:

- `url` is the forwarded url
- `referrer` will trigger a `com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER` Broadcast once the app is installed.

## Android

The url will be rewritten by the Play Store to `link://smarquis.fr/action?key=value#data`

## Pros and Cons

➕ Changes the "Open" button in Play Store to "Continue"  
➕ Triggers a notification with "Tap to continue"  
➖ Some (in-app) browsers might directly handle these links and prevent the Play Store app to launch  
➖ When app is installed, it still opens the Play Store app and completely ignores the deeplink
